# Student Class Selection Helper (SCSH)

SCSH is a web application written with Python, JavaScript, and Google Maps API.

## Background
SCSH was originally concieved as a simple project to explore the taxicab problem (link to wikipedia here) with a series of alternative algorithims. It has since grown into a development of a web application for student schduling of classes, based on opimization of routes from one class to another.

While the COVID-19 has put a damper on the usefulness of this project as well as its implementation in real life, the team has shifted gears to instead utilize he project as a means of simulating what it would be like if a system such as SCSH were to be implemented. There is now a larger focus on the frontend as there will be more emphasis on the JavaScript to flesh out SCSH as a standalone web application.
